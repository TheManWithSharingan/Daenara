# Daenara
A full-stack demo that generates a print-ready CV through a guided Q&amp;A pipeline. A React + TypeScript frontend collects a professional profile and answers, while a FastAPI backend orchestrates LLM calls (Nebius OpenAI-compatible) to generate structured questions, validate answers, and output a single self-contained HTML CV optimized for PDF export.
